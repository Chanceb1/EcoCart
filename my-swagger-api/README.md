# My Swagger API

This project is a simple API that uses Swagger for documentation. It serves as a template for building RESTful APIs with TypeScript and Swagger.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-swagger-api.git

   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the server, run:
```bash
npm start
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Accessing Swagger UI

Once the server is running, you can access the Swagger UI documentation at:
```
http://localhost:3000/api-docs
```

### API Documentation

The API documentation is defined in both JSON and YAML formats located in the `src/swagger` directory. You can modify these files to update the API specifications.
